<h3 class="minititle2">What was the Columbian Exchange?</h3>

Prior to the Transatlantic Slave Trade, or the Slave Trade including Africa at all, there was a Trade Route, across the Atlantic Ocean, designed to exchange livestock/crops between the Eastern American Colonies and Europe. As can be seen on the right (In the Do You Know box), different crops/livestock that have been exchanged had improved the agricultural diversity in both Europe and North America. However, the diseases brought from Europe were not native to North America. The disease had killed off many of the Native Americans working on the plantation fields, which had lead to the colonizers looking for other sources of labor. The type of labor which is hardened against these diseases, the kind that is found in Africa (Which had lead to the Transatlantic Slave Route).
<br /><br />
<h3 class="minititle2"> Why did the African Kings agree to selling their people?</h3>
Because the Slaves weren't just normal people. They were usually those who were Prisoners of War or they were indentured labor who needed to pay back what they've taken (Such as loans). Other than the common slave, there were also normal people who have been kidnapped by colonizers (So they don't have to pay the African kings/merchants). The African kings agreed to selling their people because of the kind of manufactured goods the colonizers had brought. Colonizers brought firearms to the different African tribes, exciting them as they would have the upperhand in their wars, along with other manufactured goods such as textile and rum. As the African kings were offered goods that would give them an upper hand in war, just in exchange for prisoners of war/indentured slaves, they couldn't see why not.
<br /><br />
<h3 class="minititle2"> What were slaves used for and what was the long term consequence of the African Slavery?</h3>
The slaves were typically used as plantation workers - to pick cotton/sugarcane/tobacco. They were used to usually work at the plantation as raw goods from the plantations were exported to Europe - to be made into manufactured goods to be sent to Africa to the kings. Other than that, female slaves were used as domestic workers - to cook/clean/care for the young children of the slave owners. 
<br /><br />
However Due to this exploitative practice of using slaves for labor, had caused a long term consequence for the displaced Africans. <br /><strong> The African Diaspora</strong>.
<br />
The African Diaspora is the long term displacement of Africans to other landmasses such as North America. Due to this displacement, African offspring, such as African Americans, are often discriminated against and still are, as they 'don't belong there'. And the culprit who has caused the pain felt by all African Americans, is of course - The Transatlantic Slave Route.

<strong class="minititle2">What was the Transatlantic Slave Trade?</strong>: It was the series of trade routes designed to transport slaves across the Atlantic Ocean to the American Colonies, in exchange for manufactured goods to the African merchants/kings.
<br /><br />
<strong class="minititle2">The Reason that the route was formed</strong>: Due to the Columbian Exchange the colonizers needed better types of slaves (In terms of immunity). So they've turned to Africa instead as their source of labor/slaves. (The route can be seen below - of the Columbian Exchange)

Many slaves were shoved and were kept locked up in the hull for the entire boat trip from Western Africa to North America!
